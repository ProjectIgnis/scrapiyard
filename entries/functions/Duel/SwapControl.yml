---!function
name: SwapControl
namespace: Duel
description: |-
  Swaps control of 2 cards or 2 groups. If groups are provided they must contain the same number of cards and each group must contains cards on the same side of the field. If reset_phase and reset_count is specified, will behave like other effects with those resets (and so, the control will be returned when the effect has expired). Works only for monsters in Monster Zone.
