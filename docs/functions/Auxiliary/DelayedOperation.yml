  Performs an operation to a card(s) each time a given phase is entered. Returns the effect that would perform the operation, or nil if no card/group or an empty group is passed. Parameters: - Card|Group card_or_group: the cards that will be affected, - int phase: the phase when `oper` will be applied to the banished cards, - int flag: a unique integer to be registered as a flag on the affected cards, - Effect e: the effect performing the banishment, - int tp: the player performing the banishment, and will later perform `oper`, - function oper: a function with the signature (ag,e,tp,eg,ep,ev,re,r,rp)  where `ag` is the group of affected cards, - function|nil cond: an additional condition function with the signature (ag,e,tp,eg,ep,ev,re,r,rp). `ag` is already checked if it's not empty., - int|nil reset: the reset value. If not passed, the reset will be `RESET_PHASE+phase`, - int|nil reset_count: how many times the reset value must happen. If not passed, the count will be 1., - int|nil hint: a string to show on the affected cards, - int|nil effect_desc: a string to be used as the description of the delayed effect (useful when the same effect registers multiple different delayed effects)
