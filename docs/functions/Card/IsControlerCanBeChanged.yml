name: IsControlerCanBeChanged
namespace: Card
description: |-
  Checks if a card (Card c) can change control. It returns false in either of these situations:  - c's controller is PLAYER_NONE, - c is not in LOCATION_MZONE, - c is affected by EFFECT_CANNOT_CHANGE_CONTROL, - the opposing player has enough space. If bool ign is true, the monster zone checking is ignored. If int zone is provided, it uses only these zones as reference.
