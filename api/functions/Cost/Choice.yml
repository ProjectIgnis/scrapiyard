name: Choice
namespace: Cost
description: Creates a baseline [cost function](/api/types/EffectCost) that gives the player a choice between different baseline cost functions for the same effect (e.g. "Starliege Lord Galaxion"). The ellipsis (...) allows tables in the form {base cost function, effect description, additional check function} (e.g. "{Cost.DetachFromSelf(1),aux.Stringid(id,0),s.extracheck}"). [`Duel.SelectEffect`](/api/functions/Duel/SelectEffect) is used to have the player choose, and their choice is then set as the effect's label.
