description: >-
  Spirit Elimination check to (Card c). It checks if controller is affected by Spirit Elimination. If so, it will only filter in the Monster Zone, otherwise in Graveyard. (bool mustbefaceup) means the filter is not generic (e.g. Banish 1 Dragon-Type monster) opposed to banish 1 monster. (bool includemzone) when set to true will check LOCATION_MZONE by default as opposed to filtering LOCATION_MZONE and LOCATION_GRAVE depending on affected by Spirit Elimination.
