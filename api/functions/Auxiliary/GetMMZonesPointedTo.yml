---!function
name: GetMMZonesPointedTo

description: >-
  Returns the zone values (bitfield mask) of the Main Monster Zones on the field of "target_player" that are pointed to by any Link Cards, which match the "by_filter" function/filter, in the locations "player_location" and "oppo_location", from the perspective of "player". The filter by default checks that the card is face-up and is a Link Card, any additional check (e.g. archetype) is added onto that. Both locations default to LOCATION_MZONE if not provided since most cards care about zones that any Link Monster points to, if you want to include Link Spells then use LOCATION_ONFIELD, or LOCATION_SZONE to exclude Link Monsters and check for Link Spells only. The second location defaults to the first one if not provided, but 0 can be passed if you need to not count a side of the field for that location. "target_player" defaults to "player" if not provided. "..." are any additional parameters that "by_filter" might need.
