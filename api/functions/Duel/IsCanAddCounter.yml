  If only (int player) is passed, it checks if that player is not affected by "EFFECT_CANNOT_PLACE_COUNTER" that doesn't have a specific target (and thus no extra checks). If all the other 3 parameters are provided, it checks if that player is affected by "EFFECT_CANNOT_PLACE_COUNTER" effects with those parameters as arguments.
