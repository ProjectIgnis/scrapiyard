If reset_phase and reset_count is specified, will behave like other effects with those resets (and so, the control will be returned when the effect has expired).

If chose_player is provided, the player selecting the zone is the passed value, if PLAYER_NONE is passed, the player performing the selection is player (int player), otherwise the selecting player will be the current reason player.
