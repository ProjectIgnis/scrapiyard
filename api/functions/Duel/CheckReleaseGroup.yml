  Checks if there is a monster that can be used as tribute from the int player, that satisfies function, having a min and a max of the count specified with the exception of some card/group if specified, ... are extra arguments. If use_hand is true, then cards in the hand are considered for the tribute. If use_oppo is true, opponent's cards are also considered for the tribute. If check_field is true and card_to_check is passed, the function will also take in account to check if there are free zones (int zone) left on to_player's field to summon that card after tributing the cards. Also effects of cards like "Lair of Darkness" are taken into account when performing those checks.
