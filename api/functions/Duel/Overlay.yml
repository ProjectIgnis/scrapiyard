  Attachs (Card|Group of_card) to (Card c). By default, if any card in the 2nd parameter has materials attached to it as well, they'll also be attached to (Card c) automatically. If send_to_grave is true, they will instead be sent to the graveyard with REASON_RULE, if you want to do something else with those cards, you have to move them before calling this function.
