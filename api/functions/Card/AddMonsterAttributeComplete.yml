  Used in conjunction with Card.AddMonsterAttribute, completes a card's (Card c) transformation to a monster. It is best to call this after the card has arrived in Monster Zone (i.e. after Duel.SpecialSummonStep). Does nothing with cards without EFFECT_PRE_MONSTER (added automatically by Card.AddMonsterAttribute).
