name: IsSynchroSummonable
namespace: Card
description: >-
  Checks if "c" can be Synchro Summoned using "must_use" as part of its materials, choosing among "mg", with "min" and "max" materials to be used for the Synchro Summon. How this works is that the script would check for all EFFECT_SPSUMMON_PROC that has SUMMON_TYPE_SYNCHRO as it's Value, then checks the effects' Condition with the provided arguments. Check out "aux.SynCondition" in "proc_synchro.lua" for how this is handled.
