description: The ATK of a monster affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) becomes the number specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). The set value will be the monster's actual ATK, i.e., it ignores all other previous effects that change the monster's ATK. To allow applying previously-registered [effects that update the monster's ATK](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_UPDATE_ATTACK), use [`EFFECT_SET_ATTACK`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_SET_ATTACK) instead.
summary: The ATK of affected monsters becomes a specified value.
