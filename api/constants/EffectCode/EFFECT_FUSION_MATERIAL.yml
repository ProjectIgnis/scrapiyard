Also, the player performs the effect's [operation function](/api/functions/Effect/SetOperation) to select the materials to use. Effects with this code are typically registered as part of the various Fusion Summon procedure functions such as [`Fusion.AddProcMix`](/api/functions/Fusion/AddProcMix) rather than created manually.
