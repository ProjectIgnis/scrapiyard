value: 101
description: The **raw** ATK of a monster affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) becomes the number specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). "Raw" here means the set value is where calculations for the actual ATK starts, i.e., the monster's actual ATK is further calculated by applying previously-registered [effects that update the monster's ATK](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_UPDATE_ATTACK). To set a value as the actual ATK, ignoring all other previous effects that change the monster's ATK, use [`EFFECT_SET_ATTACK_FINAL`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_SET_ATTACK_FINAL) instead.
summary: The raw ATK of affected monsters becomes a specified value.
