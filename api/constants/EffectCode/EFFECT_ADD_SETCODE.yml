value: 334
description: A card affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) is **also** treated as the [archetype](/api/enums/Archetype) specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). This does not overwrite the card's current archetypes, unlike [`EFFECT_CHANGE_SETCODE`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_CHANGE_SETCODE).
summary: Affected cards are treated as an additional archetype.
