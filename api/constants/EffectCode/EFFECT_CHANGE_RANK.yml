name: EFFECT_CHANGE_RANK
enum: EffectCode
value: 133
description: The **raw** Rank of a monster affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) becomes the number specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). "Raw" here means the set value is where calculations for the actual Rank starts, i.e., the monster's actual Rank is further calculated by applying previously-registered [effects that update the monster's Rank](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_UPDATE_RANK). To set a value as the actual Rank, ignoring all other previous effects that change the monster's Rank, use [`EFFECT_CHANGE_RANK_FINAL`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_CHANGE_RANK_FINAL) instead.
summary: The raw Rank of affected monsters becomes a specified value.
