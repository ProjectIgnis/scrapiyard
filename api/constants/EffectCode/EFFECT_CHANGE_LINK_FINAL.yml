value: 422
description: The Link Rating of a monster affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) becomes the number specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). The set value will be the monster's actual Link Rating, i.e., it ignores all other previous effects that change the monster's Link Rating. To allow applying previously-registered [effects that update the monster's Link Rating](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_UPDATE_LINK), use [`EFFECT_CHANGE_LINK`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_CHANGE_LINK) instead.
summary: The Link Rating of affected monsters becomes a specified value.
