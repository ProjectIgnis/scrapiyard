description: A monster affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) can be [Normal Set](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Normal_Set) in addition to the [Normal Summon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Normal_Summon)/Set(s) the player can conduct in a turn. Effects with this code, along with [effects that grant additional Normal Summons](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_EXTRA_SUMMON_COUNT), cannot stack with each other. However, they are counted separately from [effects that change the number of Normal Summon/Sets that can be conducted](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_SET_SUMMON_COUNT_LIMIT).
summary: Affected monsters can be Normal Set in addition to the Summon/Set limit.
