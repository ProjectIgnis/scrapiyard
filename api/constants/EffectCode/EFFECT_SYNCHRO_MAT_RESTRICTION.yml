description: A card affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) cannot be used as material for a [Synchro Summon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon) unless all other materials fulfill the effect's [target function](/api/functions/Effect/SetTarget). To check the materials as a [group](/api/types/Group), use [`EFFECT_SYNCHRO_MATERIAL_CUSTOM`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_SYNCHRO_MATERIAL_CUSTOM) instead.
summary: Affected cards cannot be used with non-matching materials for Synchro Summons.
