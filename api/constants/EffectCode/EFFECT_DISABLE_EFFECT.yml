description: The **resolution** of the effects of a card affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) are negated. Unlike [`EFFECT_DISABLE`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_DISABLE), this does **not** negate non-activated effects that the card is applying. Also, it negates the resolution of activated effects **only if** the card was affected at the time of activation.
summary: Affected cards have the resolution of their effects negated.
