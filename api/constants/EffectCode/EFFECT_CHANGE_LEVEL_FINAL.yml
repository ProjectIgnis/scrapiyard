name: EFFECT_CHANGE_LEVEL_FINAL
enum: EffectCode
value: 314
description: The Level of a monster affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) becomes the number specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). The set value will be the monster's actual Level, i.e., it ignores all other previous effects that change the monster's Level. To allow applying previously-registered [effects that update the monster's Level](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_UPDATE_LEVEL), use [`EFFECT_CHANGE_LEVEL`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_CHANGE_LEVEL) instead.
summary: The Level of affected monsters becomes a specified value.
