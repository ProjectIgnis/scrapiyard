description: A card affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) cannot be [Tributed](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tributed) by a card effect that fulfills its [value function](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). This does not prevent Tributing as part of an effect's cost, unlike [`EFFECT_UNRELEASABLE_NONSUM`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_UNRELEASABLE_NONSUM).
summary: Affected cards cannot be Tributed by card effects.
