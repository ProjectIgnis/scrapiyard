description: A card affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) is **also** treated as the name (passcode) specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue). This does not overwrite the card's current passcode, unlike [`EFFECT_CHANGE_CODE`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_CHANGE_CODE).
summary: Affected cards are treated as an additional name (passcode).
