description: If a six-sided die would be rolled, the [operation function](/api/functions/Effect/SetOperation) of an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) can be performed instead. To perform an operation without preventing the die roll, use [`EFFECT_TOSS_DICE_CHOOSE`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_TOSS_DICE_CHOOSE) instead.
