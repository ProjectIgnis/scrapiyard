value: 408
description: A monster that has a Level and is affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) is also treated to have a Rank. Its Rank will initially be equal to its Level when the effect is registered, but can be independently changed after. To ensure the Rank is always equal to the Level, use [`EFFECT_LEVEL_RANK_S`](/api/constants/EffectCode/EFFECT_LEVEL_RANK_S) instead.
