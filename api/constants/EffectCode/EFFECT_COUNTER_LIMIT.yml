description: A card affected by an [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this [code](/api/functions/Effect/SetCode) can only hold a limited number of a certain counter. The limit is specified as the effect's [value](/api/functions/Effect/SetValue), and the type of counter is specified by adding it to this code (e.g. `EFFECT_COUNTER_LIMIT+COUNTER_SPELL`). Effects with this code are typically registered using [`Card.SetCounterLimit`](/api/functions/Card/SetCounterLimit) rather than created manually.
