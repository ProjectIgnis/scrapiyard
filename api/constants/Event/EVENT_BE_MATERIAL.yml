description: This event is raised when a card(s) is used as a material for a Summon. Since the event is raised **after** a Summon has been conducted, some properties of the material might have changed. If an effect needs to check or store some information that might change after the Summon, it should use [`EVENT_BE_PRE_MATERIAL`](/api/constants/Event/EVENT_BE_PRE_MATERIAL) instead.
summary: A card(s) is used as a material for a Summon.
