name: EVENT_LEAVE_FIELD
enum: Event
value: 1015
description: This event is raised when a card(s) leaves the field. Since the card has already left the field, some of its information might have changed from when it was on the field, such as its type, attribute, counters placed on it, and effects applied to it. If those are needed, [`EVENT_LEAVE_FIELD_P`](/api/constants/Event/EVENT_LEAVE_FIELD_P) should be used instead.
summary: A card(s) left the field.
