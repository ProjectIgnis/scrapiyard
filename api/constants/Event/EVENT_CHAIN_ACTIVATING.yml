description: This event is raised when a Chain Link is about to resolve before applying any other effect (such as effects that apply on [`EVENT_CHAIN_SOLVING`](/api/constants/Event/EVENT_CHAIN_SOLVING)). Typically used for mandatory continuous negation effects (e.g., ["Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror"](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Silent_Graveyard)) to make sure they are applied first and not allow other effects to respond to a negated effect.
summary: A Chain Link is about to resolve.
