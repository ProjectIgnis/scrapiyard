enum: Event
value: 1109
description: This event is raised when a card(s) is about to be used as a material for a Summon. Since the event is raised **before** a Summon is conducted, it is typically used to check or store some information that might change after the Summon, since [`EVENT_BE_MATERIAL`](/api/constants/Event/EVENT_BE_MATERIAL) would be raised too late.
summary: A card(s) is about to be used as a material for a Summon.
