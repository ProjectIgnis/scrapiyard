enum: DuelOption
value: 0x80000
description: In Duels with this option, negated Summons do not count for Summon restrictions that care about performed Summons. For example, if the Normal Summon of a player's monster was negated, the player would still be able to activate ["Rage with Eyes of Blue"](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rage_with_Eyes_of_Blue).
summary: Negated Summons do not count for restrictions that care about performed Summons.
