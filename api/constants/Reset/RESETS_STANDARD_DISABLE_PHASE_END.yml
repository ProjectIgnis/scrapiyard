description: A composite [reset value](/api/functions/Effect/SetReset) typically used for effects that a card registers only to itself until the end of the turn. An [effect](/api/types/Effect) with this reset value resets [in the End Phase](/api/constants/Phase/PHASE_END) or when [the card it's registered to](/api/functions/Effect/GetHandler) [has its effects negated](/api/constants/Reset/RESET_DISABLE) or [stops being face-up in its current location](/api/constants/Reset/RESETS_STANDARD).
summary: Typically used for effects that a card registers to itself until the End Phase.
