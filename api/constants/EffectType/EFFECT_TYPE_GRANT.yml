description: The type for [effects](/api/types/Effect) that grant another effect to other cards, e.g., ["The Weather"](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Weather) Continous Spells and Traps. The effect to be granted must be set as the [label object](/api/functions/Effect/SetLabelObject) of the effect with this type. This excludes effects that are granted by Xyz materials to the Xyz monster they are attached to, which should have [`EFFECT_TYPE_XMATERIAL`](/api/constants/EffectType/EFFECT_TYPE_XMATERIAL) instead.
