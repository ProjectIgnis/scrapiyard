Entries are in yaml format, found under [`/docs`](/docs/).
The repository is also a typescript package for the default loader module that provides typings and validates entries as strictly as possible.
This can be installed with npm.

```
npm i @that-hatter/scrapiyard
```

## Usage

The most relevant function is `loadYard`. It is recommended to use [`fp-ts`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) for the least amount of friction.

```ts
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function';
import * as TE from 'fp-ts/TaskEither';
import * as sy from '@that-hatter/scrapiyard';

const program = pipe(
  sy.loadYard(sy.DEFAULT_OPTIONS),
  TE.map(({ api }) => {
    // ...
  })
);
```

There are also more modular functions that perform specific steps, such as `loadAPI`, `loadRawAPI`, and `loadSourceRecord`.
See [`dump.ts`](/src/dump.ts) for an example usage.

If not using `fp-ts`, you will need to call the value returned by `loadYard` to get a `Promise`, and manually check if its `_tag` is `"Right"`.

```ts
const yard = await sy.loadYard(sy.DEFAULT_OPTIONS)();
if (yard._tag === 'Right') {
  const { api } = yard.right;
  // ...
}
```

## Dumping validated raws in JSON format

- Clone the repo and navigate to it.
- `npm i`
- `npm run dump`
- Check the `dump/` folder for the output (or error).
